# Lading page based on Fender's

## Description
This site was created while taking freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design certification. The task was to build a landing page for a specific product.
Since I'm also learning to play guitar I thought it was interesting to copy (or base on) Fender's landing page.

## Demo
